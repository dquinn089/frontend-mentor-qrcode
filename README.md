## Overview

This is my solution to the first project for Frontend Mentor. Using my novice level knowledge in HTML and CSS, and some help from the internet I was able to cobble together this project without any external design tools and focusing solely on utilizing vanilla HTML and CSS.

## My process

First, I reviewed the provided resources for building the QR code and examined examples of the final product, taking notes on styling details. Next, I structured the HTML, ensuring to understand the components from the examples and decided to place the content in a container. Finally, I focused on styling with CSS properties rather than using external tools, referencing the "style-guide" parameters.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

With prior knowledge of HTML and CSS web design, I gained valuable insights into useful syntax and methods I hadn't used before. Additionally, I improved my understanding of CSS styling, reducing confusion between elements, classes, and ID attributes.

### Continued development

Although I prefer to focus on gaining a deeper understanding of a few programs rather than having superficial knowledge of many, I would like to work with libraries more in the future. I'm interested in tips for web design that will allow me to spend less time on styling and more on functionality.
